<h1> The Family of Electrical Techniques</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
       The interactive plot shown below displays the family of electrical techniques used in physiotheraphy. The strength of the electrical current used is shown vs it's characteristic time. To select a region and get more information about the technique, hover over the region and information will appear.
  </p><p>
    You are being invited to use this site which was created to assist physiotherapy students particularly those studying PHYS1160 to understand the range of electrically based techniques avaliable for use. It has been created as another resource for you to use in learning about these techniques. The survey to be used to evaluate it can be found <a href='https://goo.gl/forms/iIrVkBWjX4cIbxiD3'>here</a>.
</p><p>
    This website and the survey have been created as part of one of my courses this semester. If you wish to talk to me further about this you can contact me at bianca.shurey@uqconnect.edu.au.

  <div id="TENS">
    TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) is an electrical treatment which consists of short pulses which are Biphasic symmetrical or asymmetrical in shape. It affects motor and sensory nerves. It can be used to treat musculoskeletal pain, primary dysmenorrhea, chronic pain and intractable angina; it is also used during painful procedures, for post-operative pain and during labour.
  </div>
  <div id="Galvanic">
    Galvanic is continuous Unidirectional current. It flows in a single direction for at least one second. It can cause strong sensory stimulation, hyperaemia and electrotonus. It can be used to relieve pain and accelerate healing.  It is commonly used in iontophoresis and stimulating contraction in denervated muscle.
  </div>
  <div id="sensenerve">
    Sensory and pain Nerves are affected by short pulses. Stimulating these using electricity is mainly used to alter pain perception and cortical activity, it can also be used to reduce spasticity.  It is used to treat low back, neck, knee and shoulder pain as well as post-operative pain, during child-birth and labour, primary dysmenorrhea and pelvic floor dysfunction.
  </div>
  <div id="FES">
    FES uses a sharp rising pulse to avoid accommodation in the muscle nerves. Electrical stimulation can be used to strength normal muscles and weakened muscles including reducing atrophy. Different amounts are used depending on the muscle condition.
  </div>
  <div id="interferential">
    Interferential therapy is the application of multiple out of phase currents with similar frequencies. It is used to treat pain, stimulate muscles, increase local blood flow and reduce oedema. It can cover a larger area then TENS and sometimes penetrates deeper.
  </div>
  <div id="faradic">
    Faradic or Interrupted direct current consists of monphasic squared shaped pulses.  It can be used for motor stimulation and pain relief.
  </div>
  <div id="HVGS">
    High Voltage Galvanic Stimulation(HGVS) consists of a Twinpulse waveform. It is used to relieve pain.

  </div>
  <div id="Russian">
    This technique is a slternating current delivered in rectangular bursts.
